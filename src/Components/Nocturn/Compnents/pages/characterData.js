        \n What has Leon accomplished:\n he has passed his basic schooling education from his mother and members of town handily enough, and became a scout as he thought it would take him various places to find his calling however it mostly kept him in the mountains and forests near his home town, he joined up with Jones’ scout crew after meeting him at the local tavern and beating him in a game of cards, Jones owed him money he couldnt pay so Jones told him to come to the scouts barracks to get his money and work for more after that Leon has worked with them until the day of the Goblin encounter.\

        name:'Kaius Sicarius',
        backstory: ('father Visdecus Sicarius, is a staunch Lawful good paladin of bahamut. As any self respecting bronze dragon should be as far as he was concerned.\n\
A warrior of truth and justice, often found in the guise of a humanoid knight, be it human or elf. His drive was to protect the weak and to a dragon, humanoids are weak.\n\
While in the form of an elven paladin, the father met a whimsical elven maiden, Tempestas. One who was even better with a sword than he was.\n\
 He was a force for order. She, chaos. Despite his best efforts, he fell in love. It took many years before she would admit the same.\n\
Her reluctance was in part due to the fact that she was not an elf at all, but a steel dragon.\n\
The two eventually married. It was after the birth of their first born that they discovered each other’s secret nature. She was excited by it. He, less so. He never meant to impregnate another dragon. Let alone a steel. Love had blinded and confused him, he thought.\n\
Honor bound, he vowed to stay and raise the child when hatched. At least until it could care for itself.\n\
Misfortune struck and Tempestas was killed by members of the Cult of the Dragon.\n\
The young dragon’s life was one of carefree adventure around the island he called home.\n\
Everything changed when he killed and ate his favorite meal: shark. There was a school of blue sharks gifted to a sahuangain tribe that had gained the attention of the Queen of the Depths, Umberlee.\n\
 The young dragon was obviously oblivious to this fact. Being thus unaware, he caught and killed a couple of the blue sharks. This garnered the ire of Umberlee who cursed the young dragon to be an elf, for that is what guise his parents had taken when they met.\n\
Shy and awkward around others. Mostly kept to himself and studies. He was unaware of elven traditions at first and often had a hard time explaining where he came from and why.\n\
A friendly wizened old elven wizard took him under his care and taught the dragon cum elf the art of the arcane. This the new elf took to like a fish to water, as dragons are magical by nature. \n\
He loved conjuration the most, as it goes with his love of beasts, magical ones being especially dear to him.\n\
After many years, he set off on his own. His goal to record as much of magic as possible.\n\
Still a bit socially awkward, he travels around to study, protect and help magical creatures. Writing a monster manual. Also wants to make a “textbook” for a “wizard college” where “students” can learn magic.\n\
He is searching for like minded individuals and the funds for this mighty project.'),
