        name: 'Kaya Roseheart',
        backstory: ("Kaya who was born into a poor family grew up in a small town named Thornvale which was riddled with\
corruption and deceit, and was being fought over by the two head families there the Mustardock Family and the Relinquish Family.\n\
The two rich families would try to discredit the other without bloodshed for a time, destroying the others crops and goods, however\
this lead to a boiling point where the Mustardock family decided to take arms after a massive poisoning of their crops. Enraged they\
made a militia out of their common workers and Kaya’s father being one of them the militia was sent in to raid the Relishquish’s goods.\
However they were aware of some retaliation and had their trained guards attack and kill the militia that the Mustardock Family had\
sent; this became known as the Thornvale Massacre.\n\
After the massacre only 3 young men of the militia had survived, after this event many common folk from this town fled from the\
town scared something like this may happen again. Kaya now age 11 left with her mother to a new town to start anew. The place they\
settled into was a port town and Kaya’s mom got a job as a barmaid and was told that both Kaya and her mother could stay at the\
inn/bar as long as her mom worked at the establishment. working at the tavern, both Kaya’s mother and the owner got closer together.\
The owner would occasionally take Kaya around the port town and show her the many different boats that were along the docks.") 
+("After about 5 years when Kaya was 16 both her mother and the bar owner married and the owner now Kayas step dad lived together for\
a time.\n\
Kaya had always liked the sea and the various boats she saw at the local port and often wondered would the sea take her somewhere in the future. One day a ship came into their hometown and with it they had slaves… lots of slaves… and they just walked into town selling them, people with lives, just being sold… and people were actually buying a person's life. When Kaya saw this she was appalled and remembered how her father was just used and was like property to the Mustardocks. when she got home she asked her Stepdad about it, and his response was not what she wanted to hear but a levelheaded response was “The world ain’t perfect those with money and power will seek more in any form they can. The only way to fight back is if you hold money or power. That's why the common folk are so easily taken advantage of by them. so kiddo if you wanna stop that in this world get strong or get rich I know you can do it but just remember it takes time”.\n\
After that day Kaya seeked out a mentor who could teach her about the art of combat and ran into a gentleman called Theo Victarius who would often visit the port city selling his wares from across the sea at the local market. He agreed that he would train her if she helped sell his wares. Although an old codger he had experience with many weapons but specialized with swords particularly ones which he could wield with great finesse, it almost seemed the older he got the more powerful he became however when anyone asked he would claim “I’m not getting stronger kiddo I’m merely getting wiser.”\n\
After about 2 years Kaya on the edge of adulthood would meet a man by the name of Biggs Wedgeson who was a friend of Theo. Biggs was a wandering hermit who had freed slaves and serfs from their owners, and told Kaya about the oaths one makes to drive them forward towards a honest and honorable goal, and that if she truly wants to help/free others perhaps it's time she travels and sees the world with her own eyes and do what she can to make her goals real. After hearing this Kaya rushed home and told her parents at which point they told her it was ok and that they would help her get her stuff together and she could leave the next morning. Although her mother was very worried about her she still let her daughter go into the world because she knew that is what she needed to do.\n\
Upon leaving the next morning her step dad gave her some extra rations, tankard and a horn of ale as a gift to her going out on her own while looking for a ship to catch to start her journey she ran into a young man named Jake Winslow who was working on Cursed Freedom and told her that they travel around alot and see lots of things and that she should maybe join their ship after some thought she decided to board the ship and left for her journey and has been working as a crew member aboard the ship for about 10 years now."),

        name:'Lucien Astoshan',
        backstory: ("Lucien Astoshan’s first memories where of the human village, around the age of 6. He would learn that this was a common practice of the tribe’s shaman to all who enter as slaves. It tends to prevent riots or revolts if the slaves did not know from whence, they came, or who they were. Made the slaves easier to handle. They would keep their names, though. As if to mock them. He never cared. You learn early not to care, when you are a slave.\n\
        The life of a slave was a hard one. Being different didn’t help. The only tiefling in the human village, Lucien was an obvious outsider. One that seemed to attract unkind attention. As slaves where considered property and not people, it was common practice to treat them worse than livestock. This is how Lucien got his virtue name: Carrion.\n\
        Astoshan was often taunted, teased and bullied by the tribal children and youth. The Chieftan, to whom the slave belonged, would himself take out his rage on the child, on occasion. Yet there was one who never participated in the unkind acts. He would merely nod and go on his way.\n\
        Six months later the same boy was also branded as a slave and property of the Chieftan. They each treated the other with respect, and the boy, one year younger than Lucien, became the closest thing the tiefling ever had to a friend.\n\
        One day a stranger came to the village. It was three years after the child had himself entered the village. The man was well dressed and rode in a large carriage. He went to speak to the Chieftan. Many tribal children gathered to gawk at the mighty horses. The coachman shewed the children away calling them filthy vermin. The man eventually stepped out of the Chieftan's longhouse. The Chieftan was smiling and hefting a large sack that jingled like it was full of coins.\n\
        The stranger took Lucien away from the village and to a tall tower far away. It was explained to Lucien that he was now the property of Ulrich von Liechtenstein. \n\
        Ulrich was a cruel man. One that Lucien would come to learn was a vampire and necromancer. Also, a dabbler in alchemy. \
        Lucien’s blood and horns were at times used as regents by the master of the tower. What was unknown to the boy, but somehow discovered by Ulrich, is that the boy had both infernal and abyssal heritage. A unique combination, one utilized by the alchemist wizard. \n\
        Occasionally a beautiful woman or handsome man would be brought to the tower. They would then be brought into the bed chamber. The master of the tower didn’t sleep there, he slept in a coffin elsewhere. The bed chamber is where he dined. Lucien was the one who had to clean up after. \n\
        Astoshan was the only living slave in the tower. The rest being undead. He was informed early on that if he stepped out of line or annoyed the master of the tower or tried to run, that the undead would feast on the boy’s organs. \n\
        Lucien did much of the dirty work for Ulrich. He would be picked up by the man in the carriage at times and taken around to towns where he had to dig up bodies to be used by the master of the tower. He also helped in alchemy experiments. \n\
        Ulrich had grown bored of magical undead and wanted to make one through alchemy. He had gained manuscripts of a mad gnome. Ones that claimed to be able to recreate life through science. \n\
        Lucien collected body parts to make a whole body. Ulrich mixed various portions to bring life from death but failed time and time again. One night the master of the tower had an idea to use energy found in lightning. It just fried the body. Ulrich shrieked in frustration. Lucien hid. He remained hidden for the whole night as the master of the tower raged. \n\
        The youth was now 13. \n\
        The lightning gave Ulrich another idea. He locked himself in his laboratory for months. The welcome reprieve was nice for the young tiefling who had taken to exploring the tower. \n\
        The library was of most interest as the undead left this area alone. The next 9 months that the master of the tower was at his research, the youth spent reading and learning all he could. \n\
        Food was still dropped off weekly by the man who once delivered him to this strange magical tower. \n\
        Eventually Urich remerged from his self-imposed seclusion. He was smiling. It was never good when he smiled. Yet he ignored the boy. He seemed a man possessed. He was babbling to himself about time and being able to harness it. \n\
        The next 3 months he spent preparing for the ritual. He had cleared out one of the many rooms and drew intricate sigils all over the ground. In the center was a large multicolored gem. \n\
        Items of arcane nature were placed in precise positions around the circle. Then Ulrich began chanting. It droned on for days. That is when the intruder appeared. \n\
        An elderly elf assaulted the tower with a hailstorm of spells, blasting undead and thwarting magical traps of all sorts. He was a flurry of casting, and Lucien stood staring. \n\
        Dumbfounded. The mage stopped abruptly when he saw the youth, asking whom he was. \n\
        The tiefling turned and ran to the library, when the elf was assaulted by a group of bodaks. \n\
        Seeing this as his opportunity to flee, Astoshan entered the library and grabbed a few of the magical items on display: a bag of holding, and a blank spell book of enduring. He opened the bag of holding and began tossing books inside. Soon his alchemist gear and food were also added. \n\
        Atop the mage’s tower, a storm brewed. It was magical in nature and multicolored. Ulrich was to focus this power into the gem he had prepared when the elven wizard bust in and cast a fire ball at the vampire, breaking his concentration. \n\
        The necromancer lost control of the magical storm and the spell controlling it and the energy hit a caravan that had stopped for the night at the base of the tower. \n\
        Lucien ran from the fracas. \n\
        The youth continued to run for many days. Merely sleeping where he would fall exhausted. When he would regain consciousness, he would again run until his legs gave out. Then walk, stumble, crawl, and sleep again and again. Avoiding anything that looked like civilization. \n\
        He had grabbed food which was stored in the bag of holding. \n\
        North of the human lands and south of Tabaxi is a vast sweep of forest. \n\
        In it the youth found a deep cave where he finally stopped fleeing. Eight years he spent in this cave. The tiefling had procured a book of edible flora and another on herbalism. With these he foraged for food. Occasionally he would hunt using the spells from the spell book he had also stolen. \n\
        The magic came naturally to him. Especially the necrotic arts. \n\
        He seemed a contradiction. A love for the peace, beauty, and solitude found in nature, yet an affinity for corruption of life. \n\
        It did not take long to create a home in the cave. His magic made creating afire a simple matter. Animal hides made up his bed. A clear stream ran through the woods not too far providing a space for hydration and refreshment. Fallen trees made up a wall and door of sorts at the entrance. Predators that strayed too close, soon became food, clothing, and bedding. \n\
        Luckily no monsters came his way, and thus were not a problem. \n\
        He summoned a fey spirit as a familiar that was his company. \n\
        And then there where the large number of books. Most of the day was spent reading and learning. \n\
        Eventually, after having read and re-read every book several times, the mage thought it time to travel and explore. \n\
        He came across a tabaxi village and sold most of his books for goods and equipment. \n\
        Eventually he came across a strange cave in the shape of a humanoid skull. \n\
        Inside he heard battle. A large and mighty warrior was fighting back undead. Many wounds covered the human, but he raged on. \n\
        Not sure why he did it, the tiefling joined the battle from afar slinging spells of destruction upon the undead. When the battle was over, the barbarian lay unconscious, and dying. \n\
        Lucien tilt back the heard of the human and poured in one of the many healing drafts he had created."),
