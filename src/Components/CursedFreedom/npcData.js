        name: 'Captain Mallroy',
        backstory: "Some say Captain Mallroy is cursed, some say he's lucky, others say he has no soul or destiny.\
 All I know is he showed up in the harbour on that boat, 'Cursed Freedom', all alone, no crew, just him at the helm.\
 Im no learned man but when a Lone captain upon a large vessel drifts into port with no wind, and calm seas it bodes of a curse.\n\
 Now your wondering what happened to his crew? how did he sale a 30 crew ship by himself? why did he hire 30 'souls'? even the slaves he\
bought, freeing them, but ask them if they are 'free' and they will say they still have a dept to pay.\n\
 Rumors claim he killed everyone on the ship, dead men tell no tale. Or was it he survived a plague onboard. One thing for certain he is looking for something.\
 but what that something is no one knows, just buying his time taking cargo to and fro, searching for his crew perhaps? Cursed Gold?\n\
 Mark my words nothing good comes from that ship.\n\
 How about ye fill er cup up and Bobby Jones here will tell you what you want to know of Captain Arterious Mallroy",

        name: 'Polly the Parrot',
        backstory: "Polly is Captain Mallroy parrot. His every watching squacking bird. If he squacks an order you better follow it or else Captain Mallroy will have your head\n\
        The birds chest is shaved and it looks like a tattoo of a map is etched into the flesh of that bird. But it cant be flesh, ive seen that bird die a hundred times I swear.\
        The bird is just as cursed as its owner. Mark my words nothing good comes from that 'Cursed Freedom'",
