        story: ["Started as a con man. A false magician. What a surprise when he became a sorcerer due to fey heritage on human side. Father’s ancestor had mated with a fey (Nymph).\n\
He was raised by his human father, Jejunus, who taught him the art of the con. Worked in a troop that would target corrupt rulers. His elven mother, Luciplas, was from nobility but was cast aside by family when she fell in love with a human.\
They settled in the half-elven lands. She died of plague when Ferox was a child. The family was too poor to afford healing.\n\
 The father was an alchemist by trade but did not make much money from it. He had traveled the realm with a group of merchants who were attempting to open trade routes to other cultures. They failed, but he did meet the elf who would become his wife. He turned charlatan when he realized the world was not his friend.\
One bizarre night, the troop was camped near an old stone tower. It provided some meager protection from the winds in the field they had stopped in.\n\
A storm picked up suddenly, with lightning of every hue and color. There was no rain. It was unnatural. The troop stayed huddled in their barrel topped wagons. Except for Ferox. He was drawn to out into the storm. He stared up in amazement at the beauty and horror of the event.\
A bolt stuck him. Followed by another, and then another. Until the full force of the storm seemed to concentrate on the poor half-elf. He felt pain, but it did not kill him. It was not electricity that struck him, but raw arcane energy, infusing him with… what?\
Of a sudden he disappeared. Insane laughter came from the top of the tower. The troop fled, into the now calm night, leaving their wagons and gear.\n\
Jejunus though, called out to his son, the last good thing in the gods forsaken realm. He called up to the tower. Challenging the laughter and the voice behind it, but to no avail. He searched desperately for some sort of opening but found none.\
The father spent the next 5 years searching for a way to bring his son back. He went deep into debt to a half-orc crime lord.\n\
The half-orc, Shamog Asinaini, had pulled Jejunus before him in chains and shackles. He demanded the 3k gold or he would have Jejunus’ life.\n\
There was a bright flash and Ferox stood in the room looking dazed and confused. The half-orc warriors lowered their spears. Where it not for the cries of joy and alarm from Jejunus, they would have skewered Ferox on the spot.\
After being sorted out, it was discovered that Ferox had been teleported across time and space. The last thing he remembers was being “zapped” and here he was, the same age and wearing the same clothes.\
Discovering that his father was in debt, 3k gold, to the crime lord, Ferox vowed to pay it himself (retirement). His father would be a slave working in a mine in the half-orc lands until this time.\
As Ferox left the basement and exited the home, under armed guard, he was met by the stares of half-orc. These stares became gasps as the half-elf once again disappeared in a colorful flash.\
The next thing he knew, he was alone in an underground cavern (also 3 weeks before his last appearance). A group of goblins blinking stupidly at him and rubbing their eyes, recovered, and once again he had spears pointed at him.", <br/>,
"Ferrox joined the thief's guild and soon robbed the party. While on the run he teleported through time and space, ending up 10 years in the past. Deciding to make the most of life he settled down in Hu port where\
he opened up a club/school for magicians called the 'Young Magician Cadia Academy (YMCA). After some years dealing with the corrupt goverment and gangs the love of his life walked into the YMCA.\
He got married and was planning on starting a family when tragedy struck, and he found himself travelling through time and space. Ferrox returned to Hu port under the false name of Ferroh and took over the shaby YMCA while seeking out the love of his life"]
