        story:'A kind old Lady who sought out the adventurers to help with a rat infestation in her basement\n\
        she was then the unofficial bouncer to the adventurers sewer lair where she would always offer tea and cake.\n\
        Hannah looks at these new adventurers as her own children, checking in on them when they are missing or  gone astray\n\
        She alwasy has something nice to say and always has stories to tell, she makes everyone feel as if they are the most important person to her\n\
        Hannah doesnt talk about her past or her deceased husband much but has hinted that she used to be an adventure like the group until her husband died.\n\
        Currently she is helping Pan Piper take care of refugees at the halidom. If she isnt working she is talking with Midgard.'

        When they followed the cave systems to the bright world they came across an abandoned settlement of 4 houses.\n\
        They were busy making it into their dream inn when 4 odd looking goblins came out of the caves (the adventures), they took\
        them to stay at the inn where they bargined for their stay. When the Halidom was discovered they quickly helped out around the place\
        and when the refugies started showing up, they were eager to help the new customers. Hi people'
